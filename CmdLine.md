# Command Line Protocol(for debugging/convenience)
- `"position" {"fen" | "startpos"} [fenString]`
    - Set the board position to the starting position or the fenString
- `"print"`
    - Print the current state of the board
          - Piece positions
        - Number of plies since the start of the game(starts at 0)
        - Half Move Clock
            - Used to detect 50 move rule draws
            - Draw at 100 half moves
            - Castling Rights
          - Side to move
        - Square of en passant, if available
        - Zobrist hash
- `"move" <move>`
    - makes a move
    - Standard Algebraic Notation(FIDE notation)
    - Square is a file (a-h) and rank(1-8)
    - Promotion piece is either, q(queen), r(rook), b(bishop), or n(knight)
- `"undo"`
    - Undo the last move that was made
- `"eval"`
    - Prints the static evaluation of the position
- `"qeval"`
    - Prints the quiescence search evaluation of the position
    - Currently not working
- `"search" "depth" <depth>`
- `"search" "time" <time>`
- `"search" "infinite"`
    - Performs an iterative deepening search up to depth, until time time, or until interrupted
    - Prints out the evaluation, node count, and PV of each depth
- `"stop"`
    - Stops the search
- `"tests"`
    - Runs test suite
    - Currently, only perft tests are run
- `"perft" <depth>`
    - Performs are perft up to depth
    - A perft(performance test) searches all moves up to depth and returns the number of positions reached
    - WARNING: time usage increases exponentially with depth
- `"book"`
    - Returns all the moves in the opening book
    - Opening book is currently hardcoded to "Sirius/res/gaviota_trim.pgn"
    - Prints "No moves in book found" if position is not in book
